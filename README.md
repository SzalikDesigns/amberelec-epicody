## Epic-Szalik 351ELEC Theme

This is a modern **horizontal** theme based on [Epic Noir](https://github.com/c64-dev/es-theme-epicnoir), that matches the 351ELEC black/white/red aesthetic and the RG351P handheld's resolution and aspect ratio.

All graphics sourced and edited  by: **Cody / codyv59**   + some **Szalik** addition of missing systems

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
